## 🧮 How It Works

The CGPA is calculated using the formula:

CGPA = (Σ (Grade Point × Credits)) / (Σ Credits)

Each grade is mapped to a specific point:

| Grade | Grade Point |
|-------|------------|
| O     | 10         |
| A+    | 9          |
| A     | 8          |
| B+    | 7          |
| B     | 6          |
| C     | 5          |
